    "This is an early release draft of an IRS tax form, instructions, or publication, \nwhich the IRS is providing for your information. Do not file draft forms and do \nnot rely on draft forms, instructions, and pubs for filing. We incorporate all \nsignificant changes to forms posted with this coversheet. However, unexpected \nissues occasionally arise, or legislation is passed\u2014in this case, we will post a \nnew draft of the form to alert users that changes were made to the previously \nposted draft. Thus, there are never any changes to the last posted draft of a \nform and the final revision of the form. Forms and instructions are subject to \nOMB approval before they can be officially released, so we post drafts of them \nuntil they are approved. Drafts of instructions and pubs usually have some \nadditional changes before their final release. Early release drafts are at \nIRS.gov/DraftForms and remain there after the final release is posted at \nIRS.gov/LatestForms. Also see IRS.gov/Forms.  \n",
    "Most forms and publications have a page on IRS.gov: IRS.gov/Form1040 for \n",
    "Form 1040; IRS.gov/Pub501 for Pub. 501; IRS.gov/W4 for Form W-4; and \nIRS.gov/ScheduleA for Schedule A (Form 1040), for example, and similarly for \nother forms, pubs, and schedules for Form 1040. When typing in a link, type it \ninto the address bar of your browser, not a Search box on IRS.gov. \n",
    " If you wish, you can submit comments to the IRS about draft or final forms, \ninstructions, or pubs at IRS.gov/FormsComments. Include \u201cNTF\u201d followed by the \nform or pub number (for example, \u201cNTF1040\u201d, \u201cNTFW4\u201d, \u201cNTF501, etc.) in the \nbody of the message to route your message properly. We cannot respond to all \ncomments due to the high volume we receive and may not be able to consider \nmany suggestions until the subsequent revision of the product, but we will \nreview each \u201cNTF\u201d message. If you have comments on reducing paperwork and \nrespondent (filer) burden, with respect to draft or final forms, please respond to \nthe relevant information collection through the Federal Register process; for \nmore info, click here.  \n",
